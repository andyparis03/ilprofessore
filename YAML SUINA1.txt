Collision Handling: I want to handle collision between il professore and Suina1 according to the following YAML rules:

level2, Teatro:
  description: "Il professore transitions to Level2 and tries to catch Suina1"
  transition:
    - sound: "suinasound (played once)"
  characters:
    - name: "Suina1"
      state: "Exists at the beginning of transition"
    - name: "Il professore"
      state: "Transaction from level1"
  interactions:
    on_collision:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinasound (once)"
          - "Change sprite to: suina1-attack.png (for 2 seconds)"
          - "Suina1 disappear after changing sprite"
          - "Add animated effect of sparkles sprite when disappearing"
    specific_actions:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        action: "If press F button during 1 second change sprite to suina1-attack.png"
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinafuck (once)"
          - "Increase Love score by 10 points"
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        action: "If press B button during 1 second change sprite to suina1-attack.png"
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinasound (twice)"
          - "Increase Love score by 1 point"
  

level3, Malafama:
  description: "Il professore transitions to Level3 and tries to catch Suina1"
  transition:
    - sound: "suinasound (played once)"
  characters:
    - name: "Suina1"
      state: "Exists at the beginning of transition"
    - name: "Il professore"
      state: "Transaction from level1"
  interactions:
    on_collision:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinasound (once)"
          - "Change sprite to: suina1-attack.png (for 2 seconds)"
          - "Suina1 disappear after changing sprite"
          - "Add animated effect of sparkles sprite when disappearing"
    specific_actions:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        action: "If press F button during 1 second change sprite to suina1-attack.png"
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinafuck (once)"
          - "Increase Love score by 10 points"
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        action: "If press B button during 1 second change sprite to suina1-attack.png"
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinasound (twice)"
          - "Increase Love score by 1 point"


Please consider that I want to implement a scoring bar on the top of the screen with the following YAML rules:

scoring_system for Il Professore:
  energy_bars:
    - name: "Energy"
    - name: "Love"
    - name: "Friendhip"
  rules:
    - event: "Collision with Suina1 + Press B button"
      effect: "Increase Love level in the scoring bar by 10 points"
    - event: "Collision with Suina1 + Press F button"
      effect: "Increase Energy level in the scoring bar by 10 points"

Answer this question: what is the best way to implement 3 scoring bars on the screen in order to optimize space and not to interfere with the game visibility?
Give me the best coding soluntion about how to implement all bar creation and collision handling as from the yaml above.
The code should be clean and alligned with the existing modules avoiding conflicts, inconsistencies and incongruences.
