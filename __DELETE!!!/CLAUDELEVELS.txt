I would like to set up 4 different zone of the screen in level 1 where il professore can acces to enter to a new level (there are 5 level in total in the game).

The game starts with level 1.

The 5 levels are:
The level 1 is the one where the game start.
The level 2 access is on the top left of the world and is called Teatro.
The level 3 access is on the top right of the world and is called Malafama.
The level 4 access is on the down left of the world and is called Gusto.
The level 5 access is on the down right of the world and is called Chester.

When il professore walks and arrive to the top left of the level 1 it goes to the level 2 Teatro. A new world opens with background 2.

When il professore walks and arrive to the top right of the level 1 it goes to the level 3 Malafama. A new world opens with background 3.

When il professore walks and arrive to the down left of the level 1 it goes to the level 4 Gusto. A new world opens with background 4.

When il professore walks and arrive to the down left of the level 1 it goes to the level 5 Chester. A new world opens with background 5.

Each time il professore access to a level it makes the professore appear in another screen with another background.

Each level has a different background.

Tell me if it's ok with you and resume it.
