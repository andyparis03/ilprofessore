Collision Handling: I want to handle collision between il professore and Suina Evil according to the following YAML rules:

  characters:
    - name: "SuinaEvil"
    - name: "Il professore"
   interactions:
    on_collision:
      - targets: ["Suinaevil"]
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinaevileeeek (once)"
          - "Change sprite to: suina1-attack.png"
          - "wait for the B or F OR Punch action and then disappear from the canavas"
	if Punch action 



    specific_actions:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
    condition: "Press B button within 2 seconds after sprite change"
    action: 
       - "Increase Love score by 10 points"
      effects:
        - "Play sound: suinafuck (once)"

       - targets: ["Suina1"]
    condition: "Press F button within 2 seconds after sprite change"
    action: 
       - "Increase Love score by 20 points"
      effects:
        - "Play sound: suinafuck (once)"
