Collision Handling: I want to handle collision between il professore and Suina1 according to the following YAML rules:

  characters:
    - name: "Suina1"
      state: "Exists at the beginning of transition"
    - name: "Il professore"
      state: "Transaction from level1"
  interactions:
    on_collision:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
        effects:
          - "Play sound: suinasound (once)"
          - "Change sprite to: suina1-attack.png"
          - "2 seconds after sprite change the character Suina1 disappear from the canavas"

    specific_actions:
      - targets: ["Suina1"]
    condition: "Press B button within 2 seconds after sprite change"
    action: 
       - "Increase Love score by 10 points"
      effects:
        - "Play sound: suinafuck (once)"

       - targets: ["Suina1"]
    condition: "Press F button within 2 seconds after sprite change"
    action: 
       - "Increase Love score by 20 points"
      effects:
        - "Play sound: suinafuck (once)"
